# Lecture Attendance System Using Face Detection 

INTRODUCTION

1.TWO MODULES EACH CONNECTED TO A SINGULAR MONGO DATABASE.
2.MODULE 1- A MACHINE LEARNING MODULE IN PYTHON FOR FACE DETECTION
3.MODULE 2- A WEB APP FOR THE STUDENTS TO FIND THEIR OFFICIAL ATTENDANCE AND OTHER INFO.

 # WORKFLOW 
    1. First we start with our web app wherein the student would register themselves on signup page.
            Students/user need to upload all details along with a png image of their face.
    2. After the login students/users can see their attendance details
    3. The machine learning module uses a camera to detect the students faces and accordingly update their attendance info.

//Important

You have to add an .env file and within that file write a variable=>'MONGO_URL'

MONGO_URL is the connection string to your mongodb database
